# python_tcp
Python TCP (can be used to communicate between devices)

This is my python networking project. The end goal is to be able to communicate easily between two devices, where the connecting is easy etc.

The software will be a module but I will be creating an example of how it can be used.

At the moment there will be two main components to the project. The client part and the server part. At the end both should work perfectly together.

This project is a work in progress and is still in the early alpha stage.

You're welcome to have a look at the code and recommend changes or features you would like to be added.

This will be my first project on git and I hope you'll enjoy the journey from alpha to beta to full release.

Have a great day :)

PS - I have no instructions yet as I have no idea what will change in the program. I'm planning in creating instuctions when beta is released and by then the code will be commented on to make it easier to understand.
